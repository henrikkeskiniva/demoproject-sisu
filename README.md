# demoproject-sisu
This project was originally made for a programming course as a group project and thus contains code written by another team member. 
Classes StartMenuController and UserMenuController were written enitrely by another team member and the class MainMenuController contains sizeable amount of code written by another team member (the main functionality of the class was written by me).
Rest of the program was largely written by me.

This program is designed to help you plan-out your degree program and uses Kori API to access information related to courses and other modules. Due to a already-crossed deadline, this program lacks many functions such as an english-language translation and a dropdown menu containing all the available degree programs. In its current state the user must already know the internal id of the given degree program and thus, for ease of use, the "Degree Programs" file has listed three degree programs and their ids.
